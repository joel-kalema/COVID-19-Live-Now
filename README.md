The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

**`npm test`**

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more
information.

[**Redux Toolkit**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) is our official recommended approach for writing Redux logic. It wraps around the Redux core, and contains packages and functions that we think are essential for building a Redux app. Redux Toolkit builds in our suggested best practices, simplifies most Redux tasks, prevents common mistakes, and makes it easier to write Redux applications.

```
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

For the Redux core library by itself:

```
npm install redux
```

For more details, see [the Installation docs page](https://redux.js.org/introduction/installation).
